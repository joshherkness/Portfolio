# Portfolio

A [portfolio website](http://www.joshherkness.com) created to showcase some of the many projects that I have been working on.

> Currently in development

### Running the project

1. Clone the repository onto your machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the projects root directory
3. Run `$ bundle exec middleman`.  
4. The Middleman server will be launched, displaying the proper host address and port number that the website can be viewed at.

### Deploying the project

The following should **only** be used by a project collaborator.

1. Clone the repository onto your machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the projects root directory.
3. Run `$ bundle exec rake publish`.
4. The `middleman-gh-pages` gem will build the project, and push the build file to the `gh-pages` branch on origin.  For more information on `middleman-gh-pages` visit [this](https://github.com/edgecase/middleman-gh-pages) link.
